# AWS EMEA Solutions Architect Hiring Assignment

This assignment is written by Sebastiaan Verbeek. In the subsequent paragraphs, I will play the role of a freelancer that helps an imagined customer that has not used AWS before. The customer is encountering issues when trying to launch the web application outlined in the CloudFormation Stack attached with this assignment. 

## Introduction

Hi John,

Thank you for considering me to work on this project. Like we discussed over the phone, I received the export of your present AWS solution in the CloudFormation Stack format (.yaml). AWS is a huge platform and I can understand the difficulties you're having in creating the best possible solution. Even for this assignment, I've had to draw out the architecture on paper to understand what you were trying to achieve. 

First, I've found a solution for your current problem. Together with a script for the in-house team, you're now able to make progress on your solution. 

Secondly, I'd like to propose some short term changes to help you improve availability, security, reliability, cost and performance before the project goes into production. This comes with an explanation for the business and technical benefits of my proposals. 

Finally, I have a high level alternative solution in mind I'd like to propose; this solution is for the longer term as your web application becomes more successful. 

### Solution for the current problem.
